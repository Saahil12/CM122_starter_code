# Getting Started

It's recommended that you start by downloading the Anaconda Python Distribution 
(we will use Python 3 syntax for this class) from https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/; 
it's available for Windows, Mac, and Linux,
and comes with all the packages you'll need for this class pre-installed.

Windows users may want to consider setting up VirtualBox with Ubuntu Linux.
While this is not necessary for this class, scientific computing is 
significantly complicated by using a Windows machine, and you'll need to use
a workaround to get the _git_ tool used for version control.

If you don't already have a Python IDE that you like, you can download the PyCharm IDE from
https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/; it has a lot of features and is much 
simpler to use than a text editor. You should be able to get free access to the
Professional edition with your .edu email; if you don't have one, the Community edition
is also sufficient.

If you have PyCharm installed, you'll want to go into Preferences 
and make sure that the anaconda python is set as the project interpreter for this project. 
Type "interpreter" into the searchbox and the project interpreter option should show up.

Finally, you'll want to set up git on your machine. If you have a Mac,
type "git" at the command line, and you'll download some XCode Developer
Tools that will set up git automatically; if you have a Windows machine,
I recommend setting up an Atlassian account and using their free
SourceTree software to set up git on your machine.

Once you have all of that, you can use the git clone command either from the
Terminal (on Mac or Linux) or from the git terminal provided by SourceTree
to download the course materials.
